# more dogs please!
The assignment was to choose a framework, write a report on it and create a POC (Proof of Concept). This is the outcome: an app for iOS and Android that generates random dog images with the [Dog API](https://dog.ceo/dog-api/). The user decides between 'corgi' and 'pug' images and is able to repeatedly generate new images by pressing on the 'another one, please!' button. The user can always go back and switch breed.
Made with React Native.
